                     </br></br><p>After graduating from McQueen High School in Reno, NV in 1984, Dr. Cellucci completed her Bachelorâ€™s degree at UC Berkeley in Anatomy and Physiology. She received her doctorate from Chicago Medical School, and underwent specialty training in Toledo, OH; throughout her career has developed a passion for cosmetic medicine. She has dreamt of owning her own spa with exactly what we offer: highly desired options at reasonable prices. She has trained over the last decade in this field and loves getting to know clients on a one-on-one basis to help them achieve personal cosmetic goals.<p>

                     <p>Dr. Cellucci is skilled at all services provided, focusing her creative energy on facial and body sculpting. She recommends using chemical peels, IPL and fractional services for excellent contour and texture, then "finalizing" one's features using Botox and fillers.  Another wonderful and immediate-result technique she uses is the injection of Asclera into unsightly veins.  These techniques can be used individually or in concert to yield beautiful, healthy skin. Please feel free to text or email her with questions or concerns, and know that she is looking forward to meeting and assisting you with your medi-spa desires.</p>

                <p>I fully understand that this is not traditional.  Nor is it even really done at all, but I  have received the very best support and input from close friends and family members along the way in getting Jeuvani started at to the wonderful place that it currently is, I just feel compelled to express my sincere gratitude to a few people who have helped to make this complicated and taxing experience a journey of joy with laughter, hugs, occasional tears, but mostly love. </p>

                                <p>First I must thank my beautiful mother, <span class="violet">Margi Cellucci</span>, for without you I would not have life, but of greater significance, without you, I would not have MY life. No person has ever invested in me the way you have. You have given of yourself so generously and worked with me under so many different pressures and decisions.  Your believe in me made it so I could answer many of the questions and when I just couldn't and you helped out in tackling some of the really tough ones together.  You are my only actual contributor and for that, I am also aware I would be in a much different space without you.  Your truly are the wings beneath my wings.  I love you forever.</p>

                                <p><span class="violet">Elaine North</span>: I am grateful to you for pulling me aside one day while we were working in the ER together explaining this new idea you had and wanted to partner and what did I think? I was so caught off guard I was actually speechless.  Me? speechless? But then we talked about a few details and pretty soon were were ordering out first Palomar and off the business took!! You are the one who led me towards this magnificent field and we had many wonderful and productive years together.</p>

You took it on to reach out of Jeuvani and transport the machines to the location in Gridley and offer some treatments to decrease clients' driving time. Our local clients in Oroville are so extremely happy about that. And I appreciate your commitment and loyalty.</p>
